    "question": "<question id=\"_Toc402171630\">Why was the requirement for private companies to have a company secretary abolished? </question>",
    "answer": "<answer><p>One of the policy drivers behind the implementation of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> was to relieve the regulatory burden on small, private companies.  The role of a company secretary can vary from company to company depending on the nature and size of the organisation.  For many smaller private companies, the role of a company secretary is predominantly administrative, eg maintaining the statutory registers of the company and ensuring compliance with filing requirements under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>.  Failure to perform some of these functions may attract a penalty under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>.</p><p>The <glossary definition=\"White Paper [Cm 6456] published on 17 March 2005\">White Paper 2005: Company Law Reform</glossary> recognised the importance of the role for private companies in this regard.  Employing a company secretary ensures that someone is focusing on compliance with administrative, yet legal, requirements, and therefore the risk of incurring potential penalties for non-compliance is reduced (Annex A, Regulatory Impact Assessment, page 279).  However, for the vast majority of smaller companies, a company secretary was considered unnecessary (<glossary definition=\"White Paper [Cm 6456] published on 17 March 2005\">White Paper 2005: Company Law Reform</glossary>, paragraph 4.5), and the recommendation to remove the requirement for private companies to appoint a company secretary was adopted from 6 April 2008.</p><p>It was left open to private companies to appoint a secretary should they wish, and the <glossary definition=\"White Paper [Cm 5553] published on 16 July 2002\">White Paper 2002: Modernising Company Law</glossary> (paragraph 6.6 part 2) envisaged that some private companies would still appoint a company secretary.  Many larger private companies, where a secretary may perform a more extensive role, will certainly choose to appoint a secretary.</p><p>See Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435017_Toc402171636\">9</a> for reasons why a private company might choose to appoint a company secretary.</p><p>For further information on the functions of a company secretary see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171708\">76</a>.</p></answer>",

    "question": "<question id=\"_Toc402171636\">Why might a private company choose to have a company secretary? </question>",
    "answer": "<answer><p>A private company may choose to appoint a company secretary even though it is not required to do so by law (<legislation>s 270(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 270(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  The principal reason why a private company might make an appointment is because the functions usually carried out by a company secretary (when all companies were obliged to appoint one) still need to be administered.  Failure to perform some of these functions may attract a penalty under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>, eg the failure to file an annual return on time under <legislation>s 858 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 858 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> (see [Section: Company names, business names and publicity/Annual return]).</p><p>In the absence of a company secretary, the burden of performing these functions will fall to the directors unless they delegate the functions to others (see below).  This will have an impact on the time spent on their principal role of directing and managing the company and its business.</p><p>See Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171708\">76</a> for further discussion of the usual functions of a company secretary.</p><p>Another reason why a private company might choose to appoint a company secretary is to encourage and promote good corporate governance.  While principally the responsibility of the directors, and of more importance for public companies (especially those with publicly traded securities), many larger private companies may still want to be seen to promote good corporate governance in order to enhance their reputations, gain credibility with external stakeholders and thereby add value to the company.  A company secretary could be appointed to take on a similar role to that of a public company secretary in relation to corporate governance (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171709\">77</a> in this regard).</p><p>In practice, the factors which might prompt the appointment of a company secretary are likely to be more prevalent in respect of larger private companies.  Joint venture companies also commonly appoint a company secretary.  This role can be strategically important since the joint venture party providing the secretary would usually have custody of the statutory registers of the company and responsibility for circulating notices of all company meetings.  As a result, the right of nomination of the company secretary may have to be rotated between the parties from time to time.</p><p>Smaller private companies which choose not to make an appointment should give due consideration as to who will carry out the functions usually reserved to the secretary.

In the editors’ view, not being capable of acting means something more than a company secretary simply being unavailable to carry out his functions for a short period of time, for example if he is away on holiday.  In these circumstances, the company secretary would not be incapable of carrying out his functions, it would just not be as practical or convenient to do so as when he were at work.  As a result, in this situation, it would not be possible for the assistant or deputy secretary to step into the shoes of the appointed company secretary, nor for the directors to authorise any person to act instead.  In the editors’ view, for a company secretary to be not capable of acting under <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, he would need to be, for example, incapacitated by an illness or accident that has left him hospitalised.</p><p>This view is not altered by the fact that the section heading to <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> refers to the secretary being ‘unable’ to act, which arguably imposes a less strict test than not being capable of acting.</p><p>It is an accepted principle of statutory interpretation that a section heading does form part of an Act of Parliament (in this case <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>) and should be considered in the interpretation process (see further at Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171724\">89</a>).  However, this does not, in the editors’ view, support seeking to construe the heading to <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> as overriding the wording used in the substantive text of that section, especially where this significantly expands the ambit of the provision.</p><p>Companies would therefore be advised to regard <legislation>s 274<legislation-reference>s 274 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> as being applicable only in rare and unusual circumstances, and not to have recourse to this as a matter of routine simply where the secretary is otherwise engaged.</p><p>In <legislation>s 274(b)<legislation-reference>s 274(b) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> there is also a reference to an assistant or deputy secretary not being capable of acting.  The same principles would presumably apply, although in practice (especially for smaller private companies) there may often simply be no assistant or deputy secretary appointed.

In practice, because of the extensive nature of the company secretary’s role and responsibilities in a public company (especially one with publicly traded securities), it is more likely that a non-director with suitable and relevant experience of being a company secretary will be appointed (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171656\">28</a> and Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171657\">29</a> as to the qualifications and experience required of a public company secretary).</p><p>On appointing a director as company secretary, regard must be given to <legislation>s 280 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 280 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>.

    "question": "<question id=\"_Toc402171653\">On what basis are joint company secretaries appointed? </question>",
    "answer": "<answer><p>As explained in Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171652\">24</a>, a company may appoint two or more persons as joint company secretaries.</p><p>The articles of association, or the relevant board resolution appointing joint secretaries, should make it expressly clear whether the company intends to appoint joint company secretaries on a joint, joint and several, or even several, basis. </p><p>In practice, joint secretaries are usually appointed on a joint basis, rather than joint and severally, or just severally.  This means that their authority and/or liability will be joint, and they will carry out their duties together.  Each will be fully authorised to carry out, and each liable for, the performance of all company secretarial duties with which they are charged. </p><p>Joint secretaries appointed on this basis will therefore work very closely together.  In particular, all joint secretaries will have to sign the forms to be filed at Companies House and any other notices and documents.  This makes it important in practice to consider the personalities of the persons appointed as joint secretaries to ensure that they are capable of working effectively together. </p><p>However, <legislation>s 44 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 44 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> should be noted.  This section governs the valid execution of a document by a company, and helps to protect a ‘purchaser’ (as defined in <legislation>s 44(5)<legislation-reference>s 44(5) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>) in its dealings with the company.  <legislation>S 44<legislation-reference>s 44 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> provides that a purchaser can presume that a document is validly executed by a company in certain circumstances, one of which is when the document is signed on behalf of the company by a director, and also by a company secretary or ‘any’ joint secretary.  As ‘any’ joint secretary may sign, this section suggests that only one joint secretary needs to sign the document, rather than both or all of them (if more than two).  This could potentially conflict with the ‘joint’ basis of the company secretaries’ appointment, and a company may find itself unintentionally bound to an arrangement where internal procedures (ie all joint secretaries acting together) have not been complied with.  </p><p>In reality, this situation is unlikely to arise as a director needs to sign the document, and the director would (presumably) act in accordance with the board’s intentions.  In the interests of good practice, it would be worth clarifying the position regarding internal authority to sign documents on the company’s behalf, especially if one joint secretary is to have authority to sign without the other.  This could be done in the articles of association, the board resolution appointing the joint company secretaries (or passed specifically for a particular situation), or in the secretaries’ terms of employment (if any, see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171672\">43</a> on whether a company secretary needs a written agreement on appointment).</p><p>In the same vein, if the company intends that other tasks are to be divided between jointly appointed company secretaries, this intention and details of the division of tasks should be made clear in the articles, the board resolution appointing the joint secretaries or the terms of their appointment (if any) in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding.

In <em><case-reference>Re Fenwick, Stobart &amp; Co Ltd [1902] 1 Ch 507<canonical-case-reference>Re Fenwick, Stobart &amp; Co Ltd [1902] 1 Ch 507</canonical-case-reference></case-reference></em> the court held that, as a general rule, a fact which comes to the company secretary’s knowledge as secretary of one company is not necessarily notice to him as secretary of the other company purely by virtue of the common relationship.  In order for it to be such notice, it must be shown that it was his duty to the first company to communicate his knowledge to the second company. </p><p>Similarly, notice received by a company secretary in his private capacity as an individual, and not in the course of a company’s business, is not necessarily valid notice to the company: <em><case-reference>The Société Générale de Paris v Janet Walker (1885) 11 App Cas 20, HL<canonical-case-reference>The Société Générale de Paris v Janet Walker (1885) 11 App Cas 20, HL</canonical-case-reference></case-reference></em>.</p><p>In practice, such issues arise principally in relation to smaller, private companies which choose to appoint a company secretary.  In public companies (especially those with publicly traded securities) and larger private companies, the role of a company secretary is likely to involve a significant workload, leaving little time for an appointment elsewhere (other than to companies within the same group, where these issues should be capable of appropriate management).  In any event, it would be usual for a company secretary in such an organisation to seek express permission and/or declare any potential conflict of interest prior to taking up an additional appointment of any nature.</p><p>See Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171708\">76</a> for further discussion of the usual functions of a company secretary and Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171709\">77</a> for the role of a company secretary in corporate governance.</p></answer>",

    "answer": "<answer><p>Yes, in principle.  <glossary definition=\"explanatory notes to CA 2006\">EN</glossary> paragraph 511 specifically states by reference to <legislation>s 273 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 273 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> that there is no requirement that a company secretary be a natural person.

Any person appointed as such needs to have one or more of the qualifications set out in <legislation>s 273(2)<legislation-reference>s 273(2) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171656\">28</a> for details of these), but it is not entirely clear that a corporation could strictly satisfy this requirement.  A corporation cannot be a member of any of the professional bodies set out in <legislation>s 273(3)<legislation-reference>s 273(3) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, and it cannot be a barrister, advocate or solicitor.

However, this sweep-up provision would not appear to extend to the directors, or other employees, of a corporate secretary.  The wording seems to envisage looking only at the qualities of the corporate entity itself, even though this can of course only function through the people within it.  A previous or existing appointment as a corporate secretary of a private company might constitute a position satisfying <legislation>s 273(2)(d)<legislation-reference>s 273(2)(d) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, though only where the nature and status of that private company enables the directors to conclude that the corporate secretary being appointed is capable of discharging the functions of secretary of the public company.</p><p>The only other <legislation>s 273(2)<legislation-reference>s 273(2) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> qualification applicable to a corporate company secretary is that the person to be appointed has held the office of secretary of a public company for at least three of the five years immediately preceding his appointment as secretary (<legislation>s 273(2)(a)<legislation-reference>s 273(2)(a) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).

It seems implicit from <legislation>s 273(2)(a)<legislation-reference>s 273(2)(a) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> that holding the office of secretary of a public company for less than three of the five years immediately preceding the appointment should not be relied upon by the directors as a position satisfying <legislation>s 273(2)(d)<legislation-reference>s 273(2)(d) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, even though <legislation>s 273(2)(d)<legislation-reference>s 273(2)(d) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> does not include any requirements as to time periods.</p><p>It is also important for the directors of a public company to be able to discharge their duty under <legislation>s 273(1)(a)<legislation-reference>s 273(1)(a) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> ‘to take all reasonable steps to secure that the secretary (or each joint secretary) of the company is a person who appears to them to have the requisite knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of secretary of the company’ (on which see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932435018_Toc402171657\">29</a>), and the knowledge and experience of a corporate entity are not straightforward concepts to assess.</p><p>Despite the technical difficulty, the appointment of a corporation as company secretary of a public company is certainly envisaged in practice, most obviously in Part 2 Section C of Companies Form IN01 (application to register a company), and in Companies Form AP04 (used for the subsequent appointment of a corporate secretary).  These forms provide for the appointment of corporate secretaries and are not restricted to private companies.</p><p>Clearly, it is in the interests of the directors of a public company to appoint someone as company secretary who is appropriately qualified, with the requisite knowledge and experience, whether that is a natural person or a corporate body with appropriately experienced and knowledgeable personnel.

    "answer": "<answer><p>There is a duty under <legislation>s 273(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 273(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> on the directors of a public company to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the company secretary is a person who appears to them to have the requisite knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of secretary of the company.

In the editors’ view, in plain terms, the use of the word ‘all’ suggests a higher, more onerous, obligation than just taking ‘reasonable steps’, but is balanced by the use of the word ‘reasonable’.  This indicates that the obligation is not so onerous as to involve excessive expenditure, or requiring the directors to devote a disproportionate amount of time to the task of appointing a company secretary, taking them away from their main role of running the business effectively.  </p><p>It is the editors’ view that, in practice, what ‘all reasonable steps’ means will vary from company to company according to its size, the nature of the company’s business and the extent of the duties the company intends the secretary to carry out.  The level of responsibility and specific expertise required of the secretary will dictate the type and the extent of the steps to be taken, and will be directly proportionate to the cost and time involved, in finding the right person.</p><p>Public companies, especially those with publicly traded securities, tend to rely significantly on the company secretary as a valued adviser to the board.  Therefore, the company secretary must possess the knowledge and experience to fulfil this important role, which extends above and beyond the expertise required to perform the more administrative functions of the traditional company secretary role.
