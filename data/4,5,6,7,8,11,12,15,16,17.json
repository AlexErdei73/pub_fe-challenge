    "answer": "<answer><p>There are, broadly, two regimes in <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>: one for communications pursuant to <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> between a company and others; the other for the service of documents on a company or its officers.  Both regimes are described further below.</p><p><em>Sending of documents</em>: in the course of its operations a company will need to communicate with its members or third parties, such as companies or businesses with which it deals.  The importance of ensuring that all such communications are effectively made and received is clear.  <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> therefore sets out separate procedures for:<ol><li><p>the sending of documents and information <em>to</em> a company (<legislation>ss 1144 to 1148<legislation-reference>s 1144 to 1148</legislation-reference></legislation> and Schedule 4 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>); and</p></li><li><p>the sending of documents and information <em>by</em> a company (<legislation>ss 1144 to 1148<legislation-reference>s 1144 to 1148</legislation-reference></legislation> and Schedule 5 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>).</p></li></ol></p><p>These rules are set out in the ‘company communications provisions’, which is the collective legislative term for <legislation>ss 1144 to 1148<legislation-reference>s 1144 to 1148</legislation-reference></legislation> and Schedules 4 and 5 (<legislation>s 1143(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1143(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).

    "answer": "<answer><p><glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> introduced a new regime for company communications, a key aim of which was to facilitate the use of electronic communications.  However, the provisions are not limited to electronic communications and govern all communications by and to companies which are made under the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861213\">4</a>).</p><p>Limited provision had been made under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 1985\">CA 1985</glossary> for the use of electronic communications in specified circumstances (including in relation to notices of meeting, proxy appointments and the circulation of annual accounts and reports).  However, there was no general provision covering company communications, leading to uncertainty as to whether electronic communications could be used in other circumstances.  In addition, the <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 1985\">CA 1985</glossary> provisions required the active consent of members to electronic communications in all circumstances.  As a result, take-up of these methods of communication was patchy.</p><p>In contrast, the company communications provisions of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> are designed to encourage take-up of one type of electronic communication in particular: by website.  Where a company wishes to communicate documents or information by means of a website it can, subject to certain conditions, treat consent to receiving information in that form as having been given (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861254\">33</a>).  In broad terms, this means that members must actively opt out of accepting communications via a website if that is the method of communication which the company wishes to use.  As a result, companies can benefit from the cost savings and speed offered by electronic delivery.  In addition, members and others are not burdened with unwanted hard copies of company information.  </p><p>Even though website communication is encouraged, there are protections to ensure that a company cannot unilaterally decide that it will only communicate electronically.  Anyone giving active or deemed consent to electronic communications is entitled to revoke their agreement at any time.  In addition, there is a general right for members to be provided with a hard copy of documents communicated electronically (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861270\">48</a>).</p></answer>",

    "answer": "<answer><p>The company communications provisions are intended to be of general application (in contrast to the <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 1985\">CA 1985</glossary> regime: see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861211\">2</a>).  References in the company communications provisions to provisions of the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary> authorising or requiring a document or information to be sent or supplied include all such provisions, whatever expression is used, and references to documents or information being sent or supplied are construed accordingly (<legislation>s 1148(2) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1148(2) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  Possible alternative expressions are not given in <legislation>s 1148<legislation-reference>s 1148 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, but are suggested in <legislation>s 1168(7) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1168(7) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> (for example ‘deliver’ or ‘provide’: see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861222\">12</a>).</p><p>Therefore, provided that the document or information in question is sent or supplied pursuant to a provision of the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary>, the company communications provisions will govern how it may be communicated (subject to any applicable limitation or variation of the effect of those provisions: see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861215\">6</a>).  It is important to note that many sections of <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> expressly refer to, or tacitly require the use of, the company communications provisions.  A failure to comply with the company communications provisions in these circumstances will mean that the statutory provision authorising or requiring the communication in question has also been breached.</p><p>As mentioned above, the communication of documents or information authorised or required by <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> is governed by the company communications provisions, subject to any applicable limitations or variations.  For example, to the extent expressly permitted by <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>, a company’s articles of association may vary certain of the company communications provisions (as discussed in Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861215\">6</a>).  Accordingly, it is important to check the articles for relevant content when proposing to make a communication under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> and also to remember that the articles continue to govern communications outside <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary>, for example if the articles require a pre-emption notice to be given prior to a transfer of shares.  However, the fact that the company communications provisions are generally applicable means that companies already in existence when the <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> regime came into force do not need to amend their articles to take advantage of the company communications provisions, although there may be advantages in doing so (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861305\">74</a>).</p><p>A number of terms are defined for the purposes of the company communications provisions by <legislation>s 1168 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1168 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861222\">12</a>).  </p><p>It is worth remembering that as well as the company communications provisions, <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> contains separate, but potentially overlapping, provisions as to service of documents on companies and their officers which are not limited to documents authorised or required to be sent or supplied under the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary> (see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861208\">1</a>).</p><p>For the meaning of ‘company communications provisions’ see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861212\">3</a>.</p></answer>",

The company communications provisions are expressly made subject to any requirements imposed, or contrary provision made, by or under any enactment (<legislation>s 1143(2) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1143(2) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).

The issue is discussed in more detail below but, to summarise, the company communications provisions: (a) govern communications under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> <em>by or to</em> a ‘company’ (as narrowly defined in <legislation>s 1 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>); and (b) in the case of communications <em>to</em> such a company, govern communications under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> sent by any body corporate (by reason of the extended definition of ‘company’ in <legislation>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  </p><p>The reasoning behind this interpretation of the legislation is as follows.  In the company communications provisions, ‘company’ includes any body corporate (<legislation>s 1148(1)<legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>).  ‘Body corporate’ is defined in <legislation>s 1173(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1173(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>.  The extended definition in <legislation>s 1148(1)<legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> means that the company communications provisions may affect not just companies formed and registered under <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> (or predecessor legislation) within the meaning of <legislation>s 1<legislation-reference>s 1 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> but also, for example, companies incorporated in other jurisdictions and other bodies corporate such as <glossary definition=\"limited liability partnership\">LLP</glossary>s.  </p><p>The extended definition in <legislation>s 1148(1)<legislation-reference>s 1148(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> does not have as great a scope as might first appear.  Under <legislation>s 1143(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary><legislation-reference>s 1143(1) <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation>, the company communications provisions have effect for the purposes of provisions of the <glossary definition=\"has the meaning given in s 2 CA 2006 (ie the company law provisions of CA 2006 (being Parts 1 to 39, and 45 to 47 so far as they apply for the purposes of those Parts); Part 2 CAICEA 2004; and the provisions of CA 1985 and CCCPA 1985 that remain in force)\">Companies Acts</glossary> authorising or requiring documents or information to be sent or supplied by or to a ‘company’.  <legislation>S 1143<legislation-reference>s 1143 <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary></legislation-reference></legislation> does not itself form part of the ‘company communications provisions’.

    "answer": "<answer><p>The term ‘authentication’ is used in <glossary definition=\"Companies Act 2006\">CA 2006</glossary> to encompass the possibility of a communication being delivered in electronic form, rather than in hard copy.  If a hard copy document is being delivered, ‘authenticated’ effectively means ‘signed’.

Where that is the case, a sender communicating a document or information in electronic form should state his full name (his identity) in the covering communication (for example, the email attaching the document).

In the editors’ view, communication from an email address which is different from that usually used by the sender, and which does not include any elements identifying it as his, might give rise to some concerns.  In the first instance, these are perhaps best addressed by the company contacting the sender using his usual email address or by telephone.

In the editors’ view, a telephone call does not qualify as a communication in ‘electronic form’ (although a telephone number may constitute an ‘electronic address’ for other purposes: see Q&amp;A <a href=\"#1433932431217_Toc411861238\">23</a>).</p><p>The requirement that the sender or supplier ‘reasonably considers’ that the recipient can read and retain a copy of the communication in that form must also be observed.  This will be a question of fact in each case but, in particular, companies communicating by electronic means should bear in mind that recipients’ computer equipment and software may be less comprehensive and up-to-date than their own.  As such, it may not be reasonable to assess recipients’ ability to read and retain communications simply by reference to the company’s systems. </p></answer>",
